## Overview
The **Intelligent Voice Assistant** is an AI-powered system that integrates **voice commands**, a **graphical user interface (GUI)**, and **face recognition** to provide a seamless and secure interaction experience. It enhances accessibility and productivity by enabling hands-free control and visual interaction.

## Features

### Phase 1: Basic Voice Assistant
- Implements **speech recognition** using the `SpeechRecognition` library.
- Uses **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** for audio output.
- Supports **basic voice commands** to interact with the system.

### Phase 2: GUI Development
- Built with **Tkinter** or **PyQt** for a user-friendly interface.
- Includes **buttons, labels, and controls** for manual interactions.
- Integrates voice assistant features within the GUI for improved usability.

### Phase 3: Face Recognition System
- Captures **video feed** using OpenCV.
- Implements **face detection and recognition**.
- Maintains a **database of authorized and unauthorized users** to enhance security.

### Phase 4: System Integration and Testing
- Combines **voice assistant**, **GUI**, and **face recognition** into a **unified system**.
- Optimized for **real-time performance and responsiveness**.
- Extensive **testing and debugging** to improve stability and accuracy.

### Phase 5: Final Touches and Presentation
- Refines the **UI/UX** for better user experience.
- Prepares a **demo and technical documentation** for final presentation.
- Adds additional features based on feedback.
